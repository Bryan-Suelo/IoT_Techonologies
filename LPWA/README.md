# Low Power Wide Area (LPWA)

Group of technologies with the following characteristics:
* Long battery life (often in excess of 10 years whilst supporting a benchmark
smart metering application)
* Wide area connectivity characteristics, allowing for out-of-the-box connected
solutions
* Low cost chipsets and networks
* Limited data communications throughput capacity

In essence, LPWA technologies complement existing cellular mobile network and
short range technologies, enabling wide area communications at lower cost points
and better power consumption characteristics. 
These same properties explain the potential for LPWA technologies: lowering the costs of wide area out-of-the box connectivity allows many more solution business-cases to ‘cost-in’, whilst untetheringdevices from a power supply allows for far greater freedom in terms of deployment locations.

Key applications for LPWA connectivity include:
* Connecting power-consuming (or storing) assets to a managed electricity grid
to enable the increased use of renewables.
* Consumer devices that are connected in order to enhance the overall value
proposition, particularly in the areas of home automation and assisted living.
* A range of smart city applications to increase the day-to-day efficiency of cities and smooth the way to a highly urbanized future.
* Diverse agricultural monitoring and control applications to allow for more
effective and efficient use of agricultural land and resources.
* Intelligent building applications to increase building efficiency.
* Supply chain applications to increase operational efficiencies and allow for new business models and optimal customer satisfaction.

### LPWA for sensor OEMs
LPWA technologies are ideally suited to sensor deployment
allowing for the flexible deployment of a wide range of sensors without need for access to power. This will significantly increase the range of scenarios where **connected device** monitoring is viable, whilst the low cost points of LPWA solutions will allow many new business cases to be costed into the product proposition.

#### What are the priority opportunities?
Immediate opportunities include all kinds of environmental monitoring (noise, light, and toxin monitoring) and a range of vibration sensing applications to detect stresses in man-made structures (including bridges, roads, railways and buildings).
In the medium term, LPWA-connected sensors are very well suited to a wide range of smart city efficiency monitoring solutions, ranging from parking space and waste bin monitoring to footfall and traffic monitoring.
