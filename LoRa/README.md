# LoRaWAN Academy

## LoRa Alliance
An open, non-profit association of members that believe
the IoT era is now. The Alliance’s mission is to standardize LPWA networks beingdeployed around the world to enable IoT, M2M, and industrial and consumer applications. 
The Alliance members collaborate to drive the global success of the
LoRaWAN™, by sharing knowledge and experience to guarantee interoperability between operators in one open global standard.

A first and crucial step for the Alliance has been to define the initial release of **LoRaWAN™**, which is available on the website for any company who wants to benefit from an open standard.
The Technical Committee of the Alliance is responsible for future enhancements drawing on inputs from all Committee Members to ensure the success of LoRaWAN™ in the IoT.
