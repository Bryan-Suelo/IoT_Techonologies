## Internet of Things
### Introduction to the Internet of Things
The term Internet of Things (often abbreviated IoT) was coined by **Kevin Ashton** in 1999 and has emerged into mainstream public view only recently. 

>The **Internet of Things** represents a general concept for the ability of networked objects that collect data from the world around us and share that data across the Internet where it can be processed and utilized for various interesting purposes.

### Four factors of IoT
1. Low cost and High Speed connectivity.
2. Adoption of IP-based networking
3. Computing Economics
4. Advances in data science

### Communication models
* **Device** to **Device**
Two or mas devices are communicated with each other. 
E.g.: Bluetooth, Z-Wave or Zigbee.
* **Device** to **Cloud**
The device is connected directly to an internet cloud service to exchange data and control data traffic.
Use traditional wired Ethernet or Wi-Fi to stablish a connection between the device and the IP network.
E.g.: Smart therostat, sends data to the cloud and data is analized.
* **Device** to **Gateway**
The device connects through an intermediate service to reach a cloud service.
A gateways acts as an intermediary between the device and the cloud service.
